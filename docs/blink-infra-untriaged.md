We are responsible for triaging the [Blink>Infra](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=component%3ABlink%3EInfra) component.

 * Change component to Blink>Infra>Ecosystem if the issue is with tools that our team maintains.
 * Try to diagnose the issue, but if necessary cc others to ask for help and leave untriaged.
