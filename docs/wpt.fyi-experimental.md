Runs for experimental Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari should happen at least daily.

If this check fails, file an issue on [wpt.fyi](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt.fyi) if all runs are affected, or [wpt](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) with the [infra label](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/labels/infra) if only some runs are missing.
